# big-data-handle
This is a home project with a large data handler without blocking the UI and the main thread. I use webworkers when it's possible, and make a downgrade system to make it in the main thread. 
My goal is to show the ability to work with large amounts of data, not with graphs, so the graph may seem a little intimidating to you)
In this project I used Vue3, Composition API, TypeScript, Pinia. I also tried to apply things as 'DDD', 'SOLID' in my project.
